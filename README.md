tafs
====
tafs (Transparent Archive Filesystem) is a filesystem wrapper, based on Dokan, that mounts an existing path and mirrors the content exactly, except for files that are supported by 7zip, which will be shown as directories, with archive content listed as regular files.

My purpose for making this was that stupid Plex does not support rar files. That is silly.
